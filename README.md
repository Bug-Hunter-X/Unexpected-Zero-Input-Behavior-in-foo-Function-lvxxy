# Unexpected Zero Input Behavior in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to unexpected behavior when both inputs of a JavaScript function are zero. The function `foo` is designed to perform a specific calculation, but it contains a flaw in how it handles the case where both inputs (`a` and `b`) are zero. 

The bug is described in detail in the `bug.js` file, and the solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
